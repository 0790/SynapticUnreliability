# SynapticUnreliabilty

In the initial stages of the project, I aim to understand methods such as DropOut and DropConnect as a means to reduce overfitting of data in a neural network.
Simultaneously, I wish to understand the brain, and the process of chemical synapses which are the means of information transfer and processing.
